# Installation

1. If Jupyter Notebook is not installed in your environment, you can install it with the following command:
```python
pip install jupyter
```
2. Make sure that the following mandatory libraries are installed in your environment. If they are not installed, you can use the pip command to install them:
```python
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

# Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing “Stacking_model.ipynb”.
3. Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:
```python
jupyter notebook
```
5. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate and open the “Stacking_model.ipynb” file.
6. Run each cell one by one, following the order of the cells in the Notebook. You can execute the code by clicking the Run button to the left of each cell.
7. View the output of each cell to see how the model is running and performing.


**Note**: 
* Make sure you have installed all the necessary libraries before running the code.
* If you encounter any problems during runtime, check that the versions of the code and libraries are compatible.
* Running the model may require some computing resources, make sure your device meets the running requirements.

```python
